      <h2>About site</h2>
      <p>
        The site describes a board game Ludo. A very famous game and could be
        found usually in every home and mobiles nowadays.
        <br />
        Back in India it has been a part of my entire childhood and I have been
        playing the game since ever.<br />
        When given the opportunity to make a site about non-electronic game,
        Ludo came to my mind.<br />
        So here is my site which explains Ludo and hope you may become part of
        the entire community who loves to play Ludo.
