        <h1>Know the play:</h1>
        Ludo is traditionally a board game. It consists of four sections of
        different colors:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Blue</li>
          <li>Yellow</li>
          <li>Red</li>
          <li>Green</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="figure">

            alt="Ludo"
          />
        </div>

        <br />
        <p>
          The first colored space outside is starting position leading to a
          clockwise path to the final position lead to centre home triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Game is usually played with 2 to 4 people. Each take turns trowing the
          die. Game starts when one gets highest number (=6).<br />
          The Goal is to move all four paws in the home triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a person gets six: the player is eligible for another turn to roll
          the die. And can move the pawn twice in same turn.
          <br />
          Be Careful! If the player gets three 6 in a row, the player loses his
          turn.

        Few tips:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Know your game: It is good to know the your strength, that is, you
            wish to move pawns in a group, so more power or individually to take
            your time and win strategically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to get as many sixes as possible: It is good to have all your
            pawns out for better strategy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Capture pawn of other players: Ludo is a game of strategy and
            involves not only simple winning but capturing other pawns to send
            them back home to clear your way to win.
          </li>
          <li>
            The colored points in the board are safe spaces. So no player can
            cut the pawn there and send it back home.
          </li>
        </ul>
