      <br />
      <p>
        The first colored space outside is starting position leading to a
        clockwise path to the final position lead to centre home triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Game is usually played with 2 to 4 people. Each take turns trowing the
        die. Game starts when one gets highest number (=6).<br />
        The Goal is to move all four paws in the home triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a person gets six: the player is eligible for another turn to roll
        the die. And can move the pawn twice in same turn.
        <br />
        Be Careful! If the player gets three 6 in a row, the player loses his
        turn.

      Few tips:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Know your game: It is good to know the your strength, that is, you
          wish to move pawns in a group, so more power or individually to take
          your time and win strategically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to get as many sixes as possible: It is good to have all your
          pawns out for better strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Capture pawn of other players: Ludo is a game of strategy and involves
          not only simple winning but capturing other pawns to send them back
          home to clear your way to win.
        </li>
        <li>
          The colored points in the board are safe spaces. So no player can cut
          the pawn there and send it back home.
        </li>
      </ul>
