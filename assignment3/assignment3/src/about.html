      <h1>Reason to choose BTS:</h1>
      <p>
        As an Army (part of BTS fandom), when I saw the opportunity to write about my favorite
        artist, I chose BTS.
        <br />
        BTS has been a part of my life since past three years. Their songs motivate me to do better
        things and to see a better version of myself.
        <br />
        Its not only the songs that I love but I respect the members. The members from time to time
        reminds us to love ourselves.
        <br />
        They said: <q>True love first begins with loving myself</q><br />
        With BTS everyday is a new chapter with an old lesson to love myself and see beauty of the
        world.<br />
        Hence, it was my honour to write about BTS.<br />
        Also, I would like to acknowledge my professor, Arezoo Tony for this wonderful chance to
        express my gratitude and love for BTS
