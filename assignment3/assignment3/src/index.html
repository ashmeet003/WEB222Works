      <h2>How did the group formed?</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Bang Si-Hyuk</b>, a well-known songwriter and music producer who founded his own company,
        Big Hit Entertainment, in 2005, is the creator of BTS.<br />
        He started gathering musicians in 2010 for a band he was calling the
        <b>Bangtan Sonyeondan</b> (also known as the BTS).

        ><br />
        The fandom is called <abbr>ARMY</abbr> [“Adorable Representative MC for Youth”].<br />
        The relationship between BTS and ARMY, according to South Korean author Jiyoung Lee, is:
        <br />
        <q>a mutual exchange between artists and their fans</q> that aims to
        <q>extending the band's message of positivity into the world</q> rather than just
        <q>ensure the band's primacy.</q>
      </p>
      <h2>Why name ARMY?</h2>
      <p>
        BTS singer RM said during an appearance on
        <u>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</u> that the fandom was almost called
        <b>"The Bells"</b> due to the similarity between the first syllables of the band's name
        (bang) and the word "bell" in Korean.<br />
        There are two meanings behind the name ARMY, which stands for more than just being a fan of
        BTS. The abbreviation ARMY, which stands for
        <b>"Adorable Representative M.C. For Youth,"</b> literally means "army." <br />
        Bangtan Sonyeondan, the Korean name of BTS, translates to "Bulletproof Boy Scouts" in
        English.
        <dfn
          >They refer to their followers as their "ARMY," and BTS is the armour that shields them,
          illustrating the band's commitment to its ARMY.</dfn
        >
      </p>
      <h2>I <span>&#128156;</span> you:</h2>
      <p>
        Kim Taehyung came up with the word <b>'Borahae'</b>, during BTS' third muster in November,
        2016.<br />
        It was combination of of two words: <em>'Bora'</em>, which means purple and
        <em>'Saranghae'</em>, which means love.<br />
        Hence, when he said <em><a href="https://g.co/kgs/CJFhy1">'I purple you army'</a></em
        >, he meant 'I love you to infinity army'. He explained it as:<br />
        <q
          >Do you know what does color purple means? Purple is the last color of the rainbow colors,
          so it means I will trust and love you for a long time.</q
        ><br />
        He additionally said:
        <q
          >I wish I can see you for a long time, just like the Borahae means. We’ll always trust you
          and go up the stairs with you.</q
        ><br />
        Since then, ARMYs around the world uses <strong>purple</strong> as a symbol of love. And
        every mention of the phrase by BTS meant them thanking army for their support and love.

        The BTS members were active in a number of charitable groups.<br />
        They collaborated with
        <abbr title="United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund">UNICEF</abbr> to
        establish the <u><b>Love Myself campaign</b></u> in 2017, which generated funds to support
        initiatives aimed at preventing violence against children and teenagers.<br />
        In light of the <abbr title="coronavirus disease of 2019">COVID-19</abbr> epidemic, BTS
        urged people to get immunised and urged young people around the world to be a spark for
        change.<br />
        To discuss the increasing spike in violence against Asian Americans in the US, the band met
        with US President Joe Biden in 2022.
      </p>
      <h2>Contribution of BTS to South Korea:</h2>
      <p>
        The economy of South Korea has grown by around $5 billion year, or 0.5%, as a result of
        rising interest in Korean literature, music, and films as well as in Korean language
        education.<br />
        According to a 2018 survey, during the previous four years, South Korea had welcomed 800,000
        foreign tourists annually for BTS-related travel.
      </p>
      <h2>Contribution of army:</h2>
      <p>
        ARMYs act to change the world in response to BTS's socially conscious lyrics. As a result,
        the fandom frequently engages in activism for charity organisations and socially conscious
        concerns including the <abbr title="coronavirus disease of 2019">COVID-19</abbr> epidemic,
        racial discrimination, children's rights, and refugee crises.<br />

            languages that we don't understand. Music is a medium that connects people. And we thank
            ARMY for enjoying our songs even though they don't speak the language.
